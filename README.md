# COVID-19 Fake News Detection Using NLP

A research project focused on detecting fake news and misinformation related to COVID-19 using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and transformer models.

## üî¨ Research Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of identifying and combating COVID-19 misinformation that proliferated during the pandemic. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing techniques and transformer-based models, this research develops an automated system capable of distinguishing between authentic health information and false claims related to COVID-19.

The increasing volume of health misinformation poses significant risks to public health decision-making. This research contributes to the development of computational tools that can assist fact-checkers, health organizations, and social media platforms in identifying potentially harmful false information at scale.

## üéØ Research Objectives

**Primary Research Goal**: Develop and evaluate machine learning models for automatic detection of COVID-19 related misinformation using state-of-the-art NLP techniques.

**Secondary Research Objectives**:
- Compare the effectiveness of different transformer architectures for health misinformation detection
- Analyze linguistic patterns and features that distinguish fake from authentic COVID-19 information
- Investigate the performance of domain-specific vs. general-purpose language models
- Evaluate the transferability of models across different types of COVID-19 content (news articles, social media posts, claims)

## üìä Research Dataset

The study utilizes a comprehensive collection of COVID-19 fact-checking datasets encompassing various content types and sources:

**ClaimFakeCOVID-19 Dataset**: Contains debunked claims and misinformation about COVID-19, sourced from fact-checking organizations and medical authorities.

**ClaimRealCOVID-19 Dataset**: Includes verified, authentic information from reputable health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and medical institutions.

**Social Media Datasets**: Twitter posts, replies, and threads related to COVID-19, providing real-world examples of how misinformation spreads across social platforms.

The datasets span multiple dimensions of COVID-19 misinformation including prevention myths, treatment claims, vaccine misinformation, and conspiracy theories.
